## [4.75.0] — 2026-04-13

SE-033 Context Rotation + SE-034 Agent Activation Plan. Era 231.
Two intelligence specs implemented: automated memory rotation with
3 cycles (daily/weekly/monthly) to enforce 25KB cap, and daily agent
activation plan mapping backlog to agents with token budgets.

### Added
- **`scripts/context-rotation.sh`**: SE-033 orchestrator with 4 modes
  (daily/weekly/monthly/status). Archives stale session-hot, retires
  old project memories, generates weekly summaries, enforces 25KB cap.
- **`/memory-rotate`**: manual context rotation command.
- **`scripts/daily-activation-plan.sh`**: SE-034 plan generator. Scans
  backlog + approved specs, maps to agents via assignment-matrix,
  allocates token budgets per tier, defers items exceeding budget.
- **`/daily-plan`**: generate/show/status for daily activation plans.
- **`tests/test-context-rotation.bats`**: 11 tests for SE-033.
- **`tests/test-daily-activation-plan.bats`**: 11 tests for SE-034.

### Changed
- **`session-init.sh`**: wired context rotation (daily/weekly/monthly)
  as async non-blocking calls at session start.

## [4.74.0] — 2026-04-13

Multi-language documentation audit and alignment. Era 231. Corrected
counters across all 9 READMEs, added 8 Code Review Court agents to
catalog, fixed broken CHANGELOG links, translated 4 missing guides to
English, and expanded Savia Enterprise README from 11 to 34 specs.

### Changed
- **All 9 READMEs** (ES, EN, GL, EU, CA, FR, DE, PT, IT): counters updated
  to 513 commands, 56 agents, 91 skills, 55 hooks; Code Review Court
  section added to Security heading.
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: structure counters and hooks line aligned to real values.
- **`agents-catalog.md`**: title and count updated from 49 to 56; 8 Court
  agents added (correctness-judge, architecture-judge, security-judge,
  cognitive-judge, spec-judge, court-orchestrator, fix-assigner, test-architect).
- **`async-hooks-config.md`**: total hook instances corrected (45 → 55).
- **`pm-workflow.md`**: command count corrected (505 → 513).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**: comparison links for v4.71.0 and v4.65.0 fixed (were
  pointing to v4.34.0 instead of their respective predecessors).
- **`docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/README.md`**: expanded from 11 specs
  to 34 specs across 5 logical groups (Core Platform, Business Operations,
  Project Lifecycle, Quality & Security, Intelligence & Optimization).

### Added
- **`docs/guides_en/guide-emergency-watchdog.md`**: EN translation.
- **`docs/guides_en/guide-prompt-security-scanner.md`**: EN translation.
- **`docs/guides_en/guide-spec-quality-auditor.md`**: EN translation.
- **`docs/guides_en/guide-workspace-consolidation.md`**: EN translation.

## [4.73.0] — 2026-04-13

Roadmap specs SE-032..034 from synthesis-console research. Era 231.
Three patterns for context lifecycle: cross-project lessons,
context rotation (daily/weekly/monthly), and daily agent activation
plans with token budgeting.

### Added
- **`SPEC-SE-032-cross-project-lessons.md`**: pipeline for extracting,
  cataloguing, and querying lessons across projects before escalating.
- **`SPEC-SE-033-context-rotation.md`**: automated rotation with 3
  cycles (daily session-hot, weekly decisions, monthly consolidation)
  to keep memory under 25KB budget.
- **`SPEC-SE-034-agent-activation-plan.md`**: daily plan generated from
  sprint backlog mapping items to agents with token budget per tier.

## [4.72.0] — 2026-04-12

Hook safety audit + registration fixes. Era 231. Fixed 4 blocking hooks
that wrote to stdout (corrupting tool output), registered 3 missing hooks
(memory-prime, cwd-changed, compress-agent-output), fixed 2 broken hook
paths, and added nidos exec bit. Total: 55 hook instances across 17 events.

### Fixed
- **4 stdout corruption bugs**: plan-gate, agent-dispatch-validate,
  dual-estimation-gate, pre-commit-review now write to stderr.
- **2 broken hook paths**: prompt-injection-guard and delegation-guard
  had empty prefix instead of `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`.
- **nidos.sh**: missing executable permission (644 → 755).

### Added
- **`memory-prime-hook.sh`** registered on UserPromptSubmit (async).
- **`cwd-changed-hook.sh`** registered on CwdChanged (new event).
- **`compress-agent-output.sh`** registered on PostToolUse/Task (async).
- **2 missing MEMORY.md index entries** for feedback memories.

## [4.71.0] — 2026-04-12
SE-028/029/030/031: Security and quality patterns inspired by Hermes Agent
research. Era 231. Prompt injection guard, iterative context compression,
skill self-improvement pipeline, and delegation depth enforcement.
### Added
- **`.claude/hooks/prompt-injection-guard.sh`**: PreToolUse hook (security
  tier) scans context files for adversarial prompt injection before
  loading. Detects override attempts, hidden Unicode, HTML comment
  injection, and social engineering patterns. Audit log in JSONL.
- **`scripts/iterative-compress.sh`**: deterministic prune (removes
  confirmations, separators, UX banners) + iterative structured summary
  that survives across multiple /compact cycles. Session-hot.md with
  delta updates instead of full rebuilds.
- **`.claude/hooks/delegation-guard.sh`**: enforces max delegation depth
  of 1 (no grandchild agents). Blocks recursive Agent/Task invocations.
  Traces all delegations in JSONL.
- **SE-028..031 specs**: 4 specs in `docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/`
  covering prompt injection, iterative compression, skill
  self-improvement, and delegation enforcement.
- **3 test suites**: 41 tests total (18 injection, 12 compression,
  11 delegation).
## [4.70.0] — 2026-04-12

SE-027 SLM Training Pipeline for inference sovereignty. Era 231.

  full spec covering architecture, data pipeline, training methods,
  governance, and 3-phase implementation plan.
- **`tests/test-slm-training.bats`**: 22 tests covering data prep
  pipeline, PII sanitization, format/validate/split, dependency
  check, forget cleanup, and edge cases.

## [4.69.0] — 2026-04-12

SE-006 Governance & Compliance Pack. Era 230. Append-only chain-hashed
audit trail for regulated clients (AI Act, DORA, NIS2, GDPR, CRA,
ISO 42001). Tamper-evident JSONL with SHA-256 chain verification and
markdown export.

### Added
- **`scripts/governance-audit-log.sh`**: append-only audit trail with
  chain hash (sha256). Subcommands: append, verify, export (md/json).
  Each entry links to previous via prev_hash for tamper detection.
- **`.claude/enterprise/rules/governance-compliance.md`**: rule
  documenting 6 compliance frameworks, audit requirements, and
  retention policies for enterprise tenants.
- **`tests/test-governance-audit-log.bats`**: 15 tests covering
  append, chain integrity, tamper detection, export, and edge cases.

## [4.68.0] — 2026-04-12

SE-005 Sovereign Deployment implementation. Era 229. Network egress guard
hook blocks outbound calls in sovereign/air-gap modes. Rule documents 4
deployment modes, agent sovereign compatibility flags, graceful degradation.

### Added
- **`.claude/enterprise/hooks/network-egress-guard.sh`**: blocks curl, wget,
  git push, npm install, etc. in sovereign/air-gap modes. Respects
  `deployment.yaml → network.allowed_hosts` exceptions. No-op when module
  disabled or no tenant active.
- **`.claude/enterprise/rules/sovereign-deployment.md`**: 4 modes (cloud,
  hybrid, sovereign, air-gap), per-tenant `deployment.yaml` config,
  `sovereign_compatible` agent flag, LLM provider abstraction (Ollama,
  vLLM, llama.cpp, LocalAI), graceful degradation policy.
- **`tests/test-sovereign-deployment.bats`**: 18 tests, SPEC-055 certified.

## [4.67.0] — 2026-04-12

SE-011 Docs Restructuring — Slice 1. Era 228. New docs taxonomy, getting
started guides (community + enterprise), enterprise overview with module
map and dependency graph, GitHub metadata sync script.

### Added
- **`docs/getting-started/community.md`**: first-session guide for Core.
- **`docs/getting-started/enterprise.md`**: module activation guide.
- **`docs/enterprise/overview.md`**: what Enterprise is and is not, module
  map with implementation status across 4 waves (26 specs), dependency graph.
- **`scripts/sync-github-metadata.sh`**: idempotent script to update repo
  description, topics, and homepage via `gh` CLI.
- New taxonomy directories: `docs/{getting-started,core,enterprise,adapters,operations,reference,i18n}/`.

## [4.66.0] — 2026-04-12

SE-010 Migration Path implementation. Era 227. Enterprise module lifecycle
manager with 6 subcommands: status, modules, enable, disable, uninstall,
migrate-data. All activations opt-in, all reversible, zero residue.

### Added
- **`scripts/savia-enterprise.sh`**: central Enterprise lifecycle command.
  Status shows Community/Enterprise mode, modules lists all 16 with ON/OFF,
  enable/disable toggle individual modules in manifest, uninstall resets all
  to Community, migrate-data runs module-specific migration wizards.
- **`scripts/lib/enterprise-helpers.sh`**: sourceable helpers for hooks and
  scripts. `enterprise_enabled "module"`, `enterprise_mode`, `enterprise_version`.
- **`tests/test-savia-enterprise.bats`**: 18 tests, SPEC-055 certified.

## [4.65.0] — 2026-04-12
SE-001 Foundations + PAT-strip security fix. Era 225.
### Added
- **`.claude/enterprise/extension-points.md`**: 6 formal extension points
  documented in the canonical Enterprise directory.
- **`.claude/enterprise/manifest.json`**: 8 new module entries
  (SE-014..026), 16 total, all disabled by default.
### Fixed
- **`scripts/pr-plan-gates.sh`**: G4 CHANGELOG reconstruction now strips
  credentials from `git remote get-url origin` output. Prevents PAT
  leakage into compare links when remote URL has embedded token. Adds
  `s|https://[^@]*@|https://|` to the sed chain.
## [4.64.0] — 2026-04-12

SE-002 Multi-Tenant & RBAC completion. Era 226. Savia Shield now treats
tenant paths as N4-private. Enterprise rule documented. All 7 acceptance
criteria satisfied. 21 BATS tests pass. Layer contract clean.

### Added
- **`.claude/enterprise/rules/multi-tenant.md`**: enterprise rule
  documenting tenant model, resolution order, isolation rules, RBAC
  declarative format, Savia Shield integration, and feature flag.

### Changed
- **`.claude/hooks/data-sovereignty-gate.sh`**: added `tenants/*` to
  the N4-private path skip list (AC4 — Savia Shield respects tenant
  boundaries). Tenant data is never scanned for public-repo leakage.

## [4.62.0] — 2026-04-12

Savia Enterprise resource, knowledge and compliance batch: 5 specs
(SE-022..026). Era 224. Second wave of enterprise capabilities covering
the operational backbone of a large consultancy.

### Added
- **SE-022 Resource & Bench Management**: utilization tracking (78-85%
  target), skills-based matching, bench optimization, EU AI Act compliant
  allocation decisions with equality shield counterfactual test.
- **SE-023 Knowledge Federation**: cross-project pattern mining with N4
  anonymization, expertise directory ("know-who"), knowledge feed at bid
  time closing the SE-019 to SE-015 loop.
- **SE-024 Client Health Intelligence**: 6-dimension health scoring
  (delivery, commercial, relationship, satisfaction, growth, payment),
  stakeholder change tracking, churn prediction.
- **SE-025 Agentic Workforce Analytics**: human vs agent throughput/cost/
  quality measurement, ROI calculation, EU AI Act transparency disclosure
  at 3 levels (none/aggregate/full), SE-013 calibration advisor.
- **SE-026 Compliance Evidence Automation**: automated audit trail for
  ISO 9001, DORA, NIS2, AI Act. Evidence harvested from git history,
  Court verdicts, allocation decisions. Auditor-ready packages.

## [4.61.0] — 2026-04-12

4 tactical patterns adopted from multica-ai research. Era 223. Path
redaction, agent result schema, concurrent executor, skills lock.

### Added
- **`scripts/path-redact.sh`**: redacts `$HOME/username` from text before
  persisting. Stdin, file, and check modes. Prevents PII leakage via
  filesystem paths in agent output and logs.
- **`.claude/schemas/agent-result.schema.json`**: structured result from
  any agent execution — duration, token counts (input/output/cache),
  model, tool calls, verdict, session ID. Enables accurate `/agent-cost`.
- **`scripts/lib/concurrent-executor.sh`**: semaphore-bounded parallel
  task execution with graceful 30s drain on shutdown. Sourceable library
  for overnight-sprint and dag-execute.
- **`scripts/skills-lock.sh`**: SHA-256 integrity verification for all
  skills and agents. Generate, verify, diff modes. Critical for
  enterprise distribution (SE-008).
- **`tests/test-multica-patterns.bats`**: BATS test suite, SPEC-055 certified.

## [4.60.0] — 2026-04-12
Code Review Court implementation (SE-021). Era 221. A panel of 5
specialized agent-judges that review AI-generated code from distinct
angles, enforcing a 400 LOC batch-size gate (Nyquist bound). Human E1
reviews findings, not raw diffs. Score formula: `100-(C×25+H×10+M×3+L×1)`.
### Added
- **`.claude/rules/domain/code-review-court.md`** (86 lines): rule
  documenting the 5 judges, scoring model, flow, batch gate, fix cycle.
- **`.claude/schemas/review-crc.schema.json`**: JSON Schema for the
  `.review.crc` artifact (judges, findings, per-file SHA-256, rounds).
- **7 new agents**: `court-orchestrator` (L4), `correctness-judge` (L1),
  `architecture-judge` (L1), `security-judge` (L1), `cognitive-judge` (L1),
  `spec-judge` (L1), `fix-assigner` (L2). All with `token_budget`.
- **`scripts/court-review.sh`**: orchestration helper — `check` (batch
  gate), `skeleton` (`.review.crc` template), `score` (formula), `hash`
  (per-file SHA-256).
- **`/court-review` command**: convenes the Court on current branch diff.
- **`tests/test-code-review-court.bats`**: 37 tests — structural, agents,
  rule, scoring, hash, skeleton, integration invariants.
## [4.59.0] — 2026-04-12

Code Review Court critical findings fix. Era 222. First dogfood of the
Court (4 judges ran on the 4 pipeline scripts) identified 4 critical bugs.
All 4 fixed in this PR, demonstrating the Court's value on its first run.

### Fixed
- **COR-001 negative version**: `awk '$2-1'` produced `X.-1.0` on major
  versions. Fix: git tag fallback + clamp minor ≥ 0.
- **COR-002 HMAC bypass**: `do_verify` silently passed without HMAC when
  secret file missing. Fix: explicit WARNING + "no cryptographic proof"
  message on stderr. Verification still passes (diff-hash match) but the
  audit trail now shows HMAC was skipped.
- **COG-001/ARCH-003 g4 complexity**: 70-line monolith split into
  `_resolve_changelog_conflict()` and `_resolve_signature_conflict()`.
  g4 is now 20 lines. Header split uses dynamic `grep -n '^## \['`
  instead of hardcoded `head -7` (fixes COR-003 magic number).
- **F-001/COG-004 PII**: hardcoded GitHub handle replaced with
  `git remote get-url origin` derivation. No personal data in source.

### Changed
- **`scripts/confidentiality-sign.sh`**: `::error::` GitHub Actions syntax
  replaced with `echo "ERROR:"` for local execution compatibility (F-007).

## [4.57.0] — 2026-04-12

Savia Enterprise Project Lifecycle batch: 5 specs (SE-016..021). Era 220.
Completes the full consultancy lifecycle suite started in Eras 208-213.
Single batch PR to avoid the cascading CHANGELOG conflict problem.

### Added
- **SE-016 Project Valuation** — Business-Case-as-Code: living NPV/IRR,
  benefit realization at 90/180/365d, portfolio dashboard, kill sentinel.
- **SE-018 Project Billing** — Revenue-as-Code: IFRS 15 POC, WIP auto-compute,
  invoice drafting with human gate, SOX audit trail, chargeback.
- **SE-019 Project Evaluation** — Lessons-as-Code: quality metrics (CMMI),
  NPS/CSAT, knowledge loop feeding lessons back to SE-015 library.
- **SE-020 Cross-Project Dependencies** — Portfolio-as-Graph: deps.yaml
  declarations, critical path, resource contention, rebalancing proposals.
- **SE-021 Code Review Court** — 5 specialized agent-judges (correctness,
  architecture, security, cognitive, spec-alignment), `.review.crc` verdicts
  with SHA-256 per file, 400 LOC batch gate, fix cycle orchestration,
  human E1 reviews findings not diffs. From Bryan Finster research.

## [4.56.0] — 2026-04-12

pr-plan G4 CHANGELOG reconstruction (replaces marker-stripping). Era 219.
When a branch is behind origin/main and CHANGELOG.md conflicts, G4 now
reconstructs the file from scratch: takes `origin/main:CHANGELOG.md` as
base, extracts this branch's new entry, and inserts it at the correct
position — above main's top version. This is deterministic and correct
regardless of how many PRs have merged since the branch was created.
The previous approach (sed-stripping conflict markers) could produce
malformed output when conflict structure was complex. The reconstruction
approach treats main's CHANGELOG as the authoritative base and simply
prepends the branch's contribution.

### Changed
- **`scripts/pr-plan-gates.sh`** (g4): full rewrite. On CHANGELOG
  conflict, extracts branch's new entry between header and main's top
  version, takes main's CHANGELOG as base, inserts entry at line 8,
  adds compare link at the correct position. Fallback to marker-strip
  if extraction fails. `.confidentiality-signature` auto-removed.
  Non-CHANGELOG conflicts still fail for human resolution.
- **`scripts/changelog-assemble.sh`** (new): fragment-based assembly
  script for future use. Reads `CHANGELOG.d/*.md` fragments and
  concatenates into CHANGELOG.md. Currently optional; will become the
  primary path when fragment workflow is adopted.
- **`CHANGELOG.d/.gitkeep`** (new): directory for future per-version
  fragments.

## [4.50.0] — 2026-04-12

Savia Enterprise Project Prospect — Pipeline-as-Code (SE-015). Era 213.
A sovereign, agent-queryable opportunity pipeline where pursuits live as
`.md` files with BANT/MEDDIC qualification scoring, bid/no-bid decision
audit trails, proposal knowledge reuse from a local library, and a
canonical sales→delivery handoff package. Blocked by SE-001, SE-002.
Blocks SE-016 (valuation), SE-017 (SOW init on win), SE-018 (billing),
SE-019 (evaluation), SE-020 (resource demand forecast from pipeline).

### Added
- **SPEC-SE-015 Project Prospect** (`docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/SPEC-SE-015-project-prospect.md`):
  pursuit.md frontmatter schema, BANT+MEDDIC qualification.yaml, bid/no-bid
  decision record, proposal library (capabilities, case-studies, team-bios,
  templates), handoff.md for sales→delivery bridge, 4 agents
  (prospect-qualifier L1, proposal-drafter L2, handoff-generator L2,
  win-loss-analyst L1), 7 commands `/pursuit-*` + `/pipeline-view`,
  5 lifecycle events (qualified, bid_decided, won, lost, handoff_completed),
  air-gap capable with Ollama. Spec proposal only.
## [4.49.0] — 2026-04-12

Savia Enterprise Project Definition — SOW-as-Code (SE-017). Era 212.
A machine-readable, agent-queryable, contract-grade Statement of Work
stored as `.md` inside the tenant's pm-workspace, with testable
acceptance criteria, YAML RACI matrix, deliverables ledger linked to
the backlog, and a structured change-request mechanism that produces
auditable amendments. Delivery work not traceable to a SOW deliverable
is refused by the workspace. Blocked by SE-001, SE-002, SE-010. Blocks
SE-018 (billing amounts derive from SOW contract value) and SE-019
(evaluation baseline is SOW deliverables vs actually-shipped).

### Added
- **SPEC-SE-017 Project Definition** (`docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/SPEC-SE-017-project-definition.md`):
  canonical SOW.md frontmatter schema, 4 new agents (sow-writer L2,
  cr-drafter L2, raci-validator L1, acceptance-linker L1), commands
  `/sow-init` `/sow-validate` `/sow-cr-draft` `/sow-amend` `/sow-query`,
  `sow.amended` event emitted on amendment signing for SE-018/SE-019
  consumers, `sow-trace-validate.sh` hook blocks orphan PBIs, JSON
  Schema + 20+ BATS tests target, air-gap capable. Spec proposal only.

## [4.48.0] — 2026-04-12

Engineering principles distilled from the Linux kernel. Era 211. Savia
mapped the Linux kernel tree (v7.0-rc7 "Baby Opossum Posse") into five
`.acm` files (INDEX + mm + kernel + net + fs) plus a patterns digest
and extracted the five most transferable engineering principles into a
new rule that applies them to pm-workspace.

### Added
- **`.claude/rules/domain/engineering-principles-from-kernel.md`** (132
  lines): five principles distilled from 37M lines of kernel source —
  (1) pay for what you use (compile-out in prod), (2) make mechanisms
  visible (no hidden control flow), (3) verify at runtime in debug,
  not compile-time, (4) interface tables over class hierarchies,
  (5) safe extension via verified bytecode (the eBPF model). Each
  principle includes "how to apply" bullets that map to concrete
  pm-workspace mechanisms (hook profiles, pr-plan gates, BATS,
  language packs, agent ops tables). Also a "what NOT to copy from
  the kernel" section so Savia doesn't over-engineer in directions
  that don't fit her I/O-bound architecture. References the research
  tree under `/home/monica/research/linux-kernel/` (outside the repo).

## [4.47.0] — 2026-04-12

pr-plan G5 queue check hardened against recurrent CHANGELOG merge conflicts.
Era 210. The old check only flagged exact version-number equality between my
branch and any open PR. That prevented number collisions but not the real
pain: two branches both insert at line 8 of `CHANGELOG.md` with different
anchors, producing a merge conflict whenever one of them lands first. The
fix enforces that my local version is **strictly greater than** every version
claimed by main OR any open PR. This guarantees a rebase after a peer lands
is always a clean "my entry on top of theirs" insertion.

### Changed
- **`scripts/pr-plan-gates.sh`** (g5): queue check now tracks `max_claimed`
  across `origin/main` top + every open PR's CHANGELOG top, and fails with
  `FAIL: version <lv> <= max in queue <max_claimed> — bump to <next>` when
  the local version does not strictly exceed the queue. Uses `sort -V` for
  semver-correct comparison (avoids the `4.10.0 < 4.2.0` lexicographic trap).
  Degrades to silent skip when `gh` is unavailable or `PR_PLAN_SKIP_QUEUE_CHECK=1`.
- **`tests/test-pr-plan-queue-check.bats`**: updated failure-message strings
  (`max in queue`, `bump to`) and added three regression tests
  (`tracks max_claimed across main and open PRs`, `uses sort -V`, Era 210
  hardening guard). 17/17 pass locally.
## [4.46.0] — 2026-04-12

Hook noise fix. Era 209. 15 shell hooks were committed to git with mode
`100644` (non-executable), causing `PreToolUse:Bash` to fail every turn
with `/bin/sh: 1: <hook>: Permission denied` (exit 126). Every clone of
the repo reproduced the noise. This change flips them to `100755` via
`git update-index --chmod=+x` without touching content.

### Fixed
- `.claude/hooks/agent-hook-premerge.sh`, `bash-output-compress.sh`,
  `config-reload.sh`, `emotional-regulation-monitor.sh`,
  `file-changed-staleness.sh`, `instructions-tracker.sh`,
  `post-tool-failure-log.sh`, `pre-compact-backup.sh`,
  `stop-memory-extract.sh`, `stress-awareness-nudge.sh`,
  `subagent-lifecycle.sh`, `task-lifecycle.sh`, `tool-call-healing.sh`,
  `lib/memory-extract-lib.sh`, `lib/profile-gate.sh` — all now
  executable. No content change.

## [4.45.0] — 2026-04-12

Savia Enterprise Release Orchestration (SE-014). Era 208. Release-as-Code for
multi-tenant consultancy delivery: a `.md`-first contract per release with
compliance profiles (standard, dora-banking, hipaa-health, gdpr-eu, nis2-critical,
airgap), human-gated deploy, and audit-safe rollback. Blocked-by SE-001, SE-002,
SE-003; blocks SE-018 (billing consumes `release.completed`) and SE-019
(evaluation baseline). Spec proposal only — implementation in a later sprint.

### Added
- **SPEC-SE-014 Release Orchestration** (`docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/SPEC-SE-014-release-orchestration.md`):
  release-plan.md canonical schema, 6 compliance profiles, 3 new agents
  (release-orchestrator L2, release-validator L1, rollback-executor L1),
  `/release-plan` + `/release-validate` commands, `release.completed` event
  consumed by SE-018/SE-019, air-gap first-class, event-driven integration with
  SE-003 MCP adapters (Azure DevOps Release + GitHub Deployments as v1 targets).

## [4.44.0] — 2026-04-11

Dual estimation rule (SE-013) with two-ratio system. Formalizes the ~10x end-to-end pipeline speedup claim and — critically — keeps TWO live ratios simultaneously: a fixed conservative `10x` (default for planning, always safe) and an updating empirical ratio computed from `data/agent-actuals.jsonl`. PM decides when to opt-in to empirical mode; conservative stays as default until the team has enough data to trust its own numbers. Era 207.

### Added
- **`.claude/rules/domain/dual-estimation.md`**: the rule. Phase breakdown, dual-ratio model (conservative 10x + empirical on-demand), canonical formula, adjustment table (trivial 15x → legacy 2x), 4 conditions for the 10x claim, sources (METR papers + n=2 HUDI + SE-002 real data).
- **`docs/propuestas/TEMPLATE.md`**: spec header updated with `Estimate (human): Nd` and `Estimate (agent): Nh` dual fields + `Category` classifier.
- **`scripts/estimate-calibrate.sh`**: reads `data/agent-actuals.jsonl`, groups by category, computes empirical speedup, suggests adjustments when samples ≥ `DUAL_ESTIMATION_MIN_SAMPLES`. Supports `--format json` and `--log`.
- **`scripts/estimate-convert.sh`**: PM-facing helper. Converts human-days to agent-hours using either `--mode conservative` (default 10x) or `--mode empirical` (opt-in, reads live ratio from actuals log). Falls back to conservative when empirical lacks samples. Supports `--category`, `--format json`, `--min-samples`.
- **`data/agent-actuals.example.jsonl`**: seed with SE-001/002/008/012 + HUDI-8865/8551 real data. The live file `data/agent-actuals.jsonl` is gitignored (PM-local tracking).
- **`tests/test-dual-estimation.bats`**: 23 BATS tests (17 original + 6 for the two-ratio helper), SPEC-055 certified.
- **`docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md`**: throughput claim block at top, linking to the rule.
- **`.claude/rules/domain/pm-config.md`**: three new config keys (`DUAL_ESTIMATION_ENABLED`, `DUAL_ESTIMATION_MIN_SAMPLES`, `AGENT_ACTUALS_LOG`).

### Changed
- Spec template and development plan now explicitly distinguish human-days from agent wall-clock hours. The conservative 10x is the planning default; empirical is opt-in when the PM trusts team data.

## [4.43.0] — 2026-04-11

Deep research over 17 external repos (legalize-es, mempalace, llmfit, rowboat,
claude-usage, feynman, Ix, qwen-code, repowise, caveman, deepteam, claude-memory-kit,
METATRON, advisor-strategy, claude-code-from-source, claudecowork, prompt-caching-2026)
produces 10 executable SDD specs targeting sprint 2026-08. Era 206.

### Added
- **SPEC-TOOLS-BY-TASK**: N-target batch tools, −49% tool calls (repowise pattern)
- **SPEC-HOOKS-OVER-PROMPTS-AUDIT**: delete rules Claude already follows (Era 165 follow-up)
- **SPEC-PROMPT-CACHING-2026**: static/dynamic split, 1h TTL, workspace isolation
- **SPEC-HOOK-CONFIG-SNAPSHOT**: freeze settings.json at session start (sticky latches)
- **SPEC-CACHE-HIT-TRACKING**: SQLite scanner for real cache hit rate measurement
- **SPEC-SAVIA-DUAL-NUPSTREAM**: Anthropic → Qwen OAuth → Ollama cascade
- **SPEC-AGENTIC-REDTEAM**: Goal Theft / Recursive Hijacking / Identity Corrosion (sprint 2026-09)
- **SPEC-LEGAL-DRIFT**: `git log` over legalize-es to detect legislative reforms
- **SPEC-RECURSION-GUARD**: `CLAUDE_INVOKED_BY` guard against sub-Claude loops

### Changed
- **SPEC-ADVISOR-STRATEGY**: extended §8 Context Safety with payload gates, timeouts,
  cascade prevention, and fallback hierarchy to prevent executor blocking on inherited
  contexts. 6 new business rules (CTX-01 to CTX-06) with per-agent budgets.

## [4.42.0] — 2026-04-11

Savia Dual installer is now fully automatic. A single command provisions
the proxy service, shell integration, and launches Claude Code with the
routing environment already applied. The user runs one script and lands
inside Claude Code with the proxy active — no manual sourcing, no new
terminal, no thinking about environment propagation. Era 205.

### Added
- **systemd unit (Linux)** `savia-dual-proxy.service` installed at
  `/etc/systemd/system/`, enabled at boot, runs as the invoking user
  with logs at `/var/log/savia-dual-proxy.log`.
- **launchd agent (macOS)** `com.savia.dual.proxy.plist` installed at
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` with `KeepAlive`.
- **Shell integration** — idempotent block appended to `~/.bashrc` and
  `~/.zshrc` that sources `~/.savia/dual/env` on every new shell, so
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is set automatically without manual intervention.
- **Health check** — `GET http://127.0.0.1:8787/health` verified right
  after the service starts.
- **Auto-launch** — the installer sources the env file in its own
  process and `exec`s `claude`, so Claude Code inherits
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` without requiring the parent shell to reload.
  A child process cannot modify its parent's environment, so
  `bash setup.sh && claude` is impossible on Unix. Exec from the same
  process sidesteps the limitation cleanly.
- **`--no-launch` flag** — install without exec'ing claude, for CI and
  headless server provisioning.
- **`--` passthrough** — arguments after `--` are forwarded to claude on
  auto-launch (e.g. `./setup-savia-dual.sh -- --resume`).

### Changed
- **Installer UX** — the final summary no longer asks the user to open
  a new terminal; the installer itself ends inside Claude Code.

## [4.41.0] — 2026-04-11

Savia Enterprise multi-tenant isolation & RBAC (SE-002). Era 206. Third P0 of the Savia → Savia Enterprise migration plan. Depends on SE-001. Core stays untouched: all new behaviour is gated by `manifest.json → multi-tenant.enabled`.

### Added
- **`.claude/enterprise/hooks/tenant-resolver.sh`**: resolves active tenant slug from `$SAVIA_TENANT` → cwd under `tenants/<slug>/` → active user profile `tenant:` key → empty (single-tenant fallback). Exposes `tenant_resolve()` for sourcing and runs standalone. Implements extension point EP-5 from SE-001.
- **`.claude/enterprise/hooks/tenant-isolation-gate.sh`**: `PreToolUse` hook (Edit|Write|Read) that blocks any cross-tenant file access with exit 2. Allowlists `.claude/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, `output/`. No-op when the multi-tenant module is disabled or no tenant is active. Audit log at `output/tenant-audit.jsonl`. Implements extension point EP-3.
- **`.claude/enterprise/commands/rbac-manager.md`**: `/rbac-manager` slash command with `grant`, `revoke`, `list`, `check` subcommands. Documents rbac.yaml schema with role inheritance (`reader` → `developer` → `admin`) and glob command patterns.
- **`scripts/rbac-manager.sh`**: backend implementation of `/rbac-manager`. Pure-bash YAML parser, atomic writes, recursive inheritance resolution, idempotent grant, no-op revoke for absent users.
- **`tests/test-tenant-isolation.bats`**: 21 BATS tests, SPEC-055 certified.
- **`tests/test-rbac-manager.bats`**: 16 BATS tests, SPEC-055 certified.
- **`docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/SE-002-extension-points.md`**: implementation notes mapping the delivered files to EP-3 and EP-5 declared in SE-001.

### Changed
- `docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/` documentation now has a concrete implementation reference for EP-3 and EP-5 beyond the SE-001 contracts.

## [4.40.1] — 2026-04-11

Savia Dual installer scripts are now fully idempotent. Re-running them
no longer re-downloads Ollama or models already present, and no longer
overwrites an existing config. Era 205.

### Fixed
- **Installer reuse logic** `scripts/setup-savia-dual.sh` and
  `scripts/setup-savia-dual.ps1` — if any `gemma4` variant is already
  installed, reuse it instead of pulling the hardware-ideal pick. The
  user's deliberate choice is honored (e.g. `gemma4:26b` kept even on
  machines where the ideal pick would be smaller).
- **Config preservation** — existing `~/.savia/dual/config.json` and
  `env` files are no longer overwritten on re-run. New `--force` /
  `-Force` flag to rewrite them explicitly; `--reconfigure` now
  implies `--force`.
- **Model detection** — stronger parsing of `ollama list` output
  (skip header, filter by `gemma4:` prefix).

## [4.40.0] — 2026-04-11

Savia Dual: inference sovereignty layer with transparent failover between
Anthropic API and local Ollama gemma4. Cloud when it works, local when it
does not. The user never gets stuck because of network, rate limits, or
provider outages. Era 205.

### Added
- **Rule** `.claude/rules/domain/savia-dual.md` — architecture, failover
  triggers, hardware-based model selection, audit log format, hard limits.
- **Skill** `.claude/skills/savia-dual/` — `SKILL.md` + `DOMAIN.md` with
  the Clara dual-doc pattern.
- **Command** `/savia-dual {install|start|stop|status|test|logs}` — full
  lifecycle management.
- **Proxy** `scripts/savia-dual-proxy.py` — Python stdlib, no external
  dependencies, transparent Anthropic → Ollama fallback on network error,
  HTTP 5xx, HTTP 429 (quota), or timeout. Circuit breaker included.
- **Installer Linux/macOS** `scripts/setup-savia-dual.sh` — installs
  Ollama, detects RAM/VRAM, picks gemma4 variant (e2b / e4b / 26b),
  downloads it, writes config.
- **Installer Windows** `scripts/setup-savia-dual.ps1` — winget-based
  equivalent with WMI hardware detection.
- **Docs** `docs/savia-dual.md` — user guide covering install, daily use,
  log format, and honest limitations compared to cloud.
- **Docs** README.md (9 languages) — new Inference Sovereignty section
  comparing Emergency Mode (manual) and Savia Dual (automatic).

### Changed
- Skill catalog auto-includes `savia-dual` under category `governance`.
- Command catalog auto-includes `/savia-dual` in capability group.

## [4.39.0] — 2026-04-11

Savia Enterprise licensing & distribution strategy (SE-008). Era 205. Second P0 of the Savia → Savia Enterprise migration plan. Depends on SE-001.

### Added
- **`LICENSE-ENTERPRISE.md`** at repo root: explicit MIT statement for the `.claude/enterprise/` layer. Identical terms to Savia Core. Formally rejects Open Core, BSL, AGPL, SaaS hosted, and pay-per-agent licensing models with the specific foundational principle each violates.
- **`TRADEMARK.md`** at repo root: policy on the "Savia" and "Savia Enterprise" names. Forks permitted with name change. Repackaging the code as a closed product under another name requires permission.
- **`docs/support-offering.md`**: six monetizable services (professional support with SLA, implantation, certified training, custom spec development, sovereignty audits, hardware integration). Services are labor, never license fees. Code stays MIT.
- **`docs/savia-enterprise-mit-forever.md`**: public statement explaining the MIT-forever commitment. Cites the 7 foundational principles and the clone-your-own-instance test.
- **`docs/propuestas/TEMPLATE.md`**: RFC template for future SPEC-XXX proposals.
- **`tests/test-licensing-files.bats`**: 27 tests covering file existence, required content, and the 5 rejected licensing models.

### Principles preserved
All 7 foundational principles unchanged. This spec is the legal guardian of the principles.

## [4.37.0] — 2026-04-11

Signal/noise reduction (SE-012). Era 203. Unblocks efficient work on Savia Enterprise migration by eliminating two chronic friction sources: false-positive Bash hooks and invisible CI failure rates.

### Removed
- **LLM-based commit validation hook** (`.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse:Bash prompt-type hook, Haiku). Root cause of recurring `PreToolUse:Bash hook error` banners: the `if: "Bash(git commit*)"` matcher fired on unrelated git subcommands (`git merge-tree`, `git commit --no-edit` for merges), and returning `{ok: false}` blocked legitimate commands. The existing deterministic `prompt-hook-commit.sh` (command-type, warning mode) already covers every real case with zero false positives and zero token cost.

### Added
- **`scripts/ci-failure-tracker.sh`**: CLI to record CI state per PR (`record`), compute failure rate aggregates (`health`), and list top recurring failures (`top`). Log is append-only JSONL at `output/ci-runs.jsonl` (N3 local, gitignored).
- **`/ci-health`** slash command: surfaces per-check failure rate and top-5 recurring causes in the last N days.
- **`tests/test-ci-failure-tracker.bats`**: 16 tests covering structure, empty/missing/malformed log handling, rate computations (0%, 100%, mixed), per-check grouping, top ordering, and append-only invariant.
- **`docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/SPEC-SE-012-signal-noise-reduction.md`**: spec with diagnosis, module breakdown, acceptance criteria.

### Fixed
- **`.gitkeep` files in `.claude/enterprise/{agents,commands,rules,skills}`**: restore empty subdirs that git was dropping. This is what caused `test-validate-layer-contract.bats` tests 11-14 and 19 to fail on CI while passing locally. Root cause of the `BATS Hook Tests` check failing on the initial push.
- **Hardcoded absolute paths in `tests/test-validate-layer-contract.bats`**: replaced occurrences of a developer-local home path with `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` so the tests follow the same PROJECT_DIR resolution the hook uses at runtime. Without this, the hook's `.claude/commands/*` pattern never matched the CI checkout path, so negative tests silently allowed instead of blocking.

### Added (Module 4 — PR Queue Check)
- **`g5()` in `scripts/pr-plan-gates.sh`**: after verifying CHANGELOG against `origin/main`, queries all open PRs via `gh api` and compares each remote branch's top `## [X.Y.Z]` entry against the local one. On collision, fails with an actionable suggestion ("rebase to X.(Y+1).0 (next free)"). Degrades gracefully when `gh` is missing or offline via `PR_PLAN_SKIP_QUEUE_CHECK=1`.
- **`tests/test-pr-plan-queue-check.bats`**: 15 tests certified by the SPEC-055 quality gate. Covers structure, opt-out env var, collision detection pattern, graceful degradation, next-free-version math, and regression invariants on pre-existing main-comparison behavior.
- **Motivation**: two real version collisions in rapid succession during an active migration. Each collision required: detect conflict → understand version chain → manual bump → rewrite CHANGELOG → fix compare links → re-merge → re-sign. The gate prevents this entire cycle.

### Impact
- Hook noise: expected reduction in false-positive Bash hook errors during git operations (merges, analysis commands, flag combinations). The remaining validation is deterministic and non-blocking.
- CI visibility: first measurable signal on pipeline reliability via `/ci-health`.
- Version collision prevention: `g5()` now catches the pattern that required manual intervention twice during this same workstream.

## [4.36.0] — 2026-04-11

Savia Enterprise foundations (SE-001). Era 202. First step of the Savia → Savia Enterprise migration plan (11 specs in `docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/`).

### Added
- **Savia Enterprise layer contract**: new `.claude/enterprise/` directory (opt-in, MIT, unidirectional). Contains `agents/commands/skills/rules` subdirs + `manifest.json` + JSON schema. All modules ship disabled by default.
- **`scripts/validate-layer-contract.sh`**: full-repo scanner that enforces "Core never imports from `.claude/enterprise/`". Full scan: 1092 files, 0 violations.
- **`.claude/hooks/validate-layer-contract.sh`**: PreToolUse hook (Edit|Write) that intercepts Core→Enterprise imports before they land on disk. Registered in `.claude/settings.json`.
- **`docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/`**: 11 executable specs (SE-001..SE-011) covering foundations, multi-tenant, MCP catalog, agent framework interop, sovereign deployment, governance pack, onboarding, licensing, observability, migration path, and docs restructuring.
- **`docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md`**: DAG with 3 parallel waves, resume protocol across sessions, escalation rules.
- **`docs/propuestas/savia-enterprise/extension-points.md`**: 6 formal extension points (agent registry, hook registry, RBAC gate, audit sink, tenant resolver, compliance validator).
- **`tests/test-validate-layer-contract.bats`**: 26 tests covering hook positive/negative cases, script full scan, manifest schema, opt-in defaults, invariant enforcement.

### Principles preserved
All 7 foundational principles remain intact (data sovereignty, vendor independence, radical honesty, absolute privacy, human decides, equality shield, identity protection). Enterprise layer is MIT, agnostic, opt-in. No vendor lock-in introduced.

## [4.35.1] — 2026-04-11

Savia Claw rescue on Lima: implement the missing HTTPS bridge as a systemd service
so SaviaClaw stops looping `remote:unreachable` SOS alerts on Nextcloud Talk.
Add `/memory-check` health command covering all 10 memory layers, and generate the
per-project Agent Code Map (ACM) for the Savia Claw subsystem. Era 204.

### Added
- **Command** `/memory-check`: 10-layer memory health check (auto-memory, JSONL store,
  vector index, SQLite cache, knowledge graph, agent memory, personal vault, session-hot,
  instincts, memory stack). Exit 0 on OK/warnings, 1 on critical failures.
- **Script** `scripts/memory-check.sh` — runs all checks, dashboard output
- **Script** `scripts/start-bridge.sh` — wrapper invoked by `remote_host.restart_bridge()`;
  prefers `systemctl restart savia-bridge` (system unit), falls back to `systemctl --user`.
- **Script** `scripts/install-savia-bridge-system.sh` — idempotent sudo installer that
  promotes the user-level `savia-bridge` to a hardened system unit so the bridge
  auto-starts on Lima reboot (PrivateTmp, ProtectSystem=strict, ProtectHome=read-only,
  NoNewPrivileges, MemoryMax=512M, CPUQuota=50%).
- **ACM** `zeroclaw/.agent-maps/` (INDEX + host/daemons + host/survival + host/comms) —
  per-project Agent Code Map for Savia Claw's 37 Python modules, complying with
  `feedback_agent_maps_per_project.md` (never at repo root).
- **Doc** `docs/savia-claw-bridge.md` — architecture, lifecycle, failure modes, and
  operational runbook for the Savia Bridge service.
- **BATS** `test-memory-check.bats` — 7 tests
- **BATS** `test-savia-bridge-scripts.bats` — 13 tests (lint-only; no sudo in CI)
- **BATS** `test-zeroclaw-agent-maps.bats` — 10 tests (format + 150-line cap)

### Changed
- `scripts/savia-bridge.service` — corrected ExecStart path from `/home/monica/savia/scripts/`
  to `/home/monica/claude/scripts/`. Added explicit `User=monica`, `Group=monica`, narrowed
  `ReadWritePaths` to `/home/monica/.savia/bridge`, added `ReadOnlyPaths=/home/monica/claude`.

### Fixed
- Root cause of the `remote:unreachable` SOS loop on Nextcloud Talk: Savia Claw's
  `remote_host.py` expected an SSH-reachable bridge, but `~/.savia/remote-host-config`
  was missing and no `scripts/start-bridge.sh` existed. Both are now provided, SSH
  loopback is wired to `monica@localhost` via a dedicated ed25519 key, and SaviaClaw
  correctly detects `is_reachable=True` and `is_bridge_running=True`.

## [4.35.0] — 2026-04-11

Lazy context architecture fix + GitHub release pipeline fix. Era 201.

### Fixed
- **Critical architecture bug**: subagents launched via Task tool were crashing with autocompact thrashing ("context refilled to the limit within 3 turns of the previous compact, 3 times in a row"). Root cause: CLAUDE.md had 15 `@import` directives that resolved recursively to 24 files totalling ~29,177 tokens. CLAUDE.md is a per-turn dynamic suffix (NOT cached system prompt), so those tokens were paid on EVERY turn, leaving Sonnet subagents with insufficient headroom after just a few tool calls.

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md**: refactored from eager `@import` model to lazy reference model. Only 3 `@imports` remain (savia.md, radical-honesty.md, autonomous-safety.md — the absolute foundational minimum). Everything else is documented as a "Lazy Reference" table with explicit paths + when to read. Agents now `Read` these files on demand instead of auto-loading them on every turn.
- **Per-turn token cost**: 29,177 tokens → 4,904 tokens (83% reduction, 24,273 tokens reclaimed per turn).
- **File count**: 24 files auto-resolved → 4 files auto-resolved.

### Validation
- Test 1: Sonnet subagent reads CLAUDE.md and answers 4 questions → completed in 1 turn, 149K tokens total (previously thrashed before completing).
- Test 2: Sonnet subagent implements a small bash script + BATS tests → completed without thrashing (blocked only by data-sovereignty hook on /tmp writes, which is correct behavior, not thrashing).

### Impact
- Subagents can now perform meaningful work before hitting compact thresholds.
- `fork-agents.sh` (SPEC-FORK-AGENT-PREFIX) is now actually usable at scale — agents won't thrash on the inherited prefix.
- The remaining 336K tokens of rules/profiles content in `.claude/rules/` are still available via `Read` — nothing was deleted, only the eager-load behavior was changed.

### Fixed (Release pipeline)
- **Critical CI bug**: GitHub releases stopped being created around v2.0.0 (March 2026) despite git tags being created correctly by `auto-tag.yml`. Root cause: GitHub Actions has a documented safeguard where workflows triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` DO NOT trigger other workflows (prevents infinite loops). Since `auto-tag.yml` pushed tags using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the tag push did NOT trigger `release.yml`, resulting in most git tags with no corresponding GitHub release.
- **Fix**: merged release creation into `auto-tag.yml` as a single workflow. It now detects the version, creates the tag, AND creates the GitHub release in one run. No cross-workflow dependency needed.
- **release.yml** is kept as a fallback for manual tag pushes by humans (explicitly skips `github-actions[bot]` actor since `auto-tag.yml` already handles that).
- Added `workflow_dispatch` trigger to `auto-tag.yml` with `force_version` input for manual re-runs if a release is missed.
- Pinned `softprops/action-gh-release` to a specific SHA per security best practice.

### Added (Release pipeline)
- **Script** `scripts/release-backfill.sh` (~190 lines): creates missing GitHub releases from existing git tags. Supports `--dry-run`, `--limit N`, `--from VERSION`, `--to VERSION`, `--force` (overwrite). Extracts changelog per-version via awk, creates releases idempotently (skips if already exists).
- **BATS** `tests/test-release-backfill.bats`: 39 tests covering script integrity, CLI flag parsing, auto-tag.yml structure, release.yml fallback behavior, CLAUDE.md lazy context validation, and edge cases. Certified by auditor.

## [4.34.0] — 2026-04-10

Savia Monitor Linux build support — deb, rpm, appimage targets. Era 200.

### Added
- **Script** `projects/savia-monitor/scripts/build-linux.sh` (~170 lines): automated Linux build with environment checks, prerequisite detection (Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora/RHEL), selective target builds (deb/rpm/appimage only), dev mode, `--check` flag for environment verification only
- **BATS** `tests/test-savia-monitor-linux.bats`: 38 tests covering script integrity, tauri.conf.json Linux targets, README alignment ES/EN, Rust source cross-platform compatibility, and build script edge cases

### Rationale
- CI workflow intentionally NOT added: Tauri Linux builds exceed 15 minutes per run, blocking PR iteration. Linux artifacts are built on-demand locally via `build-linux.sh` or on release tags, not on every push.

### Changed
- **tauri.conf.json**: added explicit bundle `targets` list (deb, rpm, appimage, msi, nsis, dmg), Linux-specific section with deb/rpm dependencies (libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0, libgtk-3-0, webkit2gtk4.1, gtk3), category Utility, short/long descriptions
- **README.md + README.en.md**: added Linux system prerequisites section (apt and dnf commands), Linux Build section with build-linux.sh usage examples
- **projects/savia-monitor/CLAUDE.md**: documented Linux build commands and targets supported matrix (Windows/macOS/Linux)

### Notes
- Rust source code was already cross-platform compatible: sessions.rs uses `/proc/{pid}` for Linux PID detection, config.rs falls back from HOME to USERPROFILE, git.rs guards Windows-specific flags with `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]`
- Build artifacts generated in `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release/bundle/` (default `~/.savia/cargo-target/savia-monitor/` per workspace convention)

## [4.33.0] — 2026-04-10

Five SPECs + implementation from deep analysis of claude-code-from-source repo (reverse-engineered Claude Code internals). Era 199.

Four patterns from Anvil research (ppazosp/anvil) — heat parallelism, competitive architects, knowledge chains, compiled agent index. Era 197.

### Added
- **Script** `heat-scheduler.sh`: lightweight heat-based parallelism — phases = sequence, heats = parallel within phase, file conflict detection (SPEC-094)

### Added

- **Human Code Maps (.hcm)**: Generated for 5 example projects (proyecto-alpha, proyecto-beta, sala-reservas, savia-web, savia-mobile-android). Narrative format with 6 sections: La historia, El modelo mental, Puntos de entrada, Gotchas, Por qué, Indicadores de deuda.
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** — Added dual code intelligence (`.acm` + `.hcm`) to Key Design Decisions, `.human-maps/` to project directory structure, and `/codemap:generate-human` to Extension Points.

### Changed

- **docs/ast-strategy.md** — Updated to quadruple strategy (Comprehensión + Quality Gates + .acm Agent Maps + .hcm Human Maps). New Part 4 section: "Human Code Maps (.hcm) — La lucha activa contra la deuda cognitiva". Updated strategy diagram and References.
- **docs/ast-strategy.en.md** — Same update in English.
- **docs/ast-strategy.ca.md** — Same update in Catalan.
- **docs/ast-strategy.de.md** — Same update in German.

Each `.hcm` entry describes cognitive debt reduction via narrative subsystem maps, commands `/codemap:generate-human`, `/codemap:walk`, `/codemap:debt-report`, and the 58% stat (Osmani 2024).

## [3.78.0] — 2026-03-29

feat: human-code-map skill — .hcm maps fighting cognitive debt; ACM system validation tests.

### Added

- **skill: human-code-map** — New skill (SKILL.md + DOMAIN.md) that generates `.hcm` (Human Code Maps), the human twin of `.acm` Agent Code Maps. 4-phase pipeline: load .acm context → debt analysis → generate narrative draft → human validation cycle. Addresses Addy Osmani's comprehension debt: devs spend 58% of time reading code; .hcm converts expensive "first walks" into reusable assets. Maturity: experimental.
- **.claude/skills/human-code-map/SKILL.md** — Full pipeline spec: Phase 1 (load .acm + 5 max source files), Phase 2 (debt-score calculation: staleness + complexity + coverage gaps), Phase 3 (generate: La historia, El modelo mental, Puntos de entrada, Gotchas, Por qué, Indicadores de deuda), Phase 4 (human validation checklist — last-walk only updatable by human). When NOT to generate: <50 LOC, pure config, generated code, single-use scripts.
- **.claude/skills/human-code-map/DOMAIN.md** — Domain context (Clara Philosophy). Key concepts: cognitive debt, first walk, walk-time (target 2-4 min), debt-score, gotcha. Business rules: .hcm always derived from .acm; debt-score >7 → escalate PM; last-walk only human; no validation = borrador. Upstream: agent-code-map + ast-comprehension. Downstream: onboarding + dev-session + spec-generate.
- **.claude/rules/domain/hcm-maps.md** — Canonical rule for .hcm lifecycle. debt-score formula: `min((days/30)*2, 4) + complexity(0-3) + (1-coverage)*3`. Lifecycle: Creation → Validation → Active → Stale → Refresh → Archive. Staleness propagation: code change → .acm hash invalid → .hcm auto-stale. Commands: `/codemap:generate-human`, `/codemap:walk`, `/codemap:debt-report`, `/codemap:refresh-human`. Directory: `.human-maps/` parallel to `.agent-maps/`.
- **.human-maps/INDEX.hcm** — First example of .hcm format applied to pm-workspace itself. Newspaper editorial metaphor (Commands = editor inbox, Agents = specialized journalists, Skills = reference library, Hooks = fact-checkers). 6 non-obvious Gotchas including: Rules not auto-loaded, Hooks are bash not prompts, .claude/commands/*.md IS the prompt, projects/ gitignored deny-by-default, E1 always human, SAVIA_HOOK_PROFILE controls hook tier.
- **ACM test report** — A/B/C comparative test of .acm Agent Code Map system showing significant improvements in files explored, tool uses, tokens consumed, and duration vs baseline.

### Changed

- **.claude/skills/agent-code-map/SKILL.md** — Added "Gemelo humano: .hcm" section cross-referencing the new human-code-map skill. Documents the .acm/.hcm duality table (audience, language, content, freshness). Staleness propagation rule: if .acm hash invalid → .hcm marked stale. Final line count: 149 (at hard limit).

## [3.77.0] — 2026-03-29

feat: agent-code-map skill — triple AST architecture with persistent .acm cross-session context maps.

### Added

- **.claude/skills/agent-code-map/SKILL.md** — Full spec: `/codemap:generate`, `/codemap:check`, `/codemap:load`, `/codemap:refresh --incremental`, `/codemap:stats` slash commands; .acm format with sha256 hash freshness; INDEX.acm navigation table; @include progressive loading; freshness model (fresco/obsoleto/roto); SDD pipeline [0] integration; 150-line limit + auto-split rule; anti-patterns.
- **.agent-maps/INDEX.acm** — Root navigation map for pm-workspace public structure: domain, infrastructure, api layers with element counts and priority (🔴🟡🟢).
- **.agent-maps/domain/entities.acm** — Domain entities: Commands, Skills, Agents, Hooks, Rules with file references and public API.
- **.agent-maps/domain/services.acm** — Business services: SprintManagement, SDD Pipeline, NLCommandResolution, ContextHealth, MemorySystem.
- **.agent-maps/infrastructure/repositories.acm** — Infrastructure access: ScriptsLayer, ProfilesStorage, ProjectsStorage, OutputStorage, HooksRuntime.

### Fixed

- **data-sovereignty-audit.sh**: premature `rm -f` on undefined `$NORM_FILE` (line 46 before definition at 85); malformed `printf` with literal `\n`; misleading `exit 0` indentation — all three bugs corrected
- **data-sovereignty-audit.sh**: changed PostToolUse entry from `async: false` to `async: true` — was blocking every Edit/Write event unnecessarily

### Added

- **settings.json**: registered 4 security hooks that existed on disk but were never executed: `block-credential-leak.sh`, `block-force-push.sh`, `block-infra-destructive.sh`, `tdd-gate.sh` — 100% BATS pass rate but zero production coverage gap now closed
- **agents-catalog.md**: documented `feasibility-probe` (bypassPermissions, Opus 4.6) and `model-upgrade-auditor` (Opus 4.6) — catalog now at 49 agents

### Added

- **Rule #25 in CLAUDE.md**: SIEMPRE `/pr-plan` antes de cualquier PR. NUNCA `push-pr.sh` directamente.
- **Sentinel `.pr-plan-ok`**: `pr-plan.sh` escribe el token tras pasar los 10 gates; `push-pr.sh` lo requiere o termina con error explicativo

- **Rule**: `meeting-participant-etiquette.md` — 4 simultaneous roles (transcriber, context guardian, query responder, proactive participant). 5-condition window for proactive speech. 3 configurable modes (silent, query, active). Post-meeting output: transcript, digest, action items, contradictions, risks, unanswered questions
- **Script**: `meeting_participant.py` — opportunity window detector (3s silence + no pending turn + critical info + not already said + PM allows). Max interventions limit, cooldown timer, mode switching, internal note buffer
- **Script**: `context_guardian.py` — cross-references live speech against decisión log, business rules, sprint state. Detects: action items (commitment language), contradictions with prior decisions, risk mentions, unanswered questions
- **Script**: `speaker_roles.py` — deterministic role-based access control in CODE. 5 levels: external → observer → developer → tech_lead → pm. Topic filter gate: `filter_response()` strips unauthorized data BEFORE voice output. NEVER_VOICE set blocks biometric, salary, credentials, PII from voice output for ALL roles including PM
- **Tests**: `test_meeting_participant.py` (12 tests) + `test_speaker_roles.py` (10 tests)

### Security design

- Speaker permissions enforced by Python `filter_response()` function, not LLM instruction
- NEVER_VOICE topics (evaluations, salary, credentials, PII, voiceprints) blocked for ALL roles in voice output — PM accesses these via console only
- Unknown speakers default to "observer" (minimal access)
- Context integrity: Savia ANNOTATES contradictions but does NOT override or modify project data based on meeting requests

## [3.17.0] — 2026-03-21

ZeroClaw meeting digest — speaker diarization + voice fingerprinting.

### Added

- **Spec**: `SPEC-008-zeroclaw-meeting-digest.md` — live meeting pipeline: audio capture → VAD → pyannote diarization → SpeechBrain voice ID → whisper STT → JSONL transcript with speaker labels → meeting-digest agent

## [3.15.0] — 2026-03-21

ZeroClaw sensory protocol + deterministic guardrails — no agent can bypass.

### Added

- **Rule**: `zeroclaw-sensory-protocol.md` — ingestion pipeline (classify → transcribe → filter → digest → persist → discard raw), confidentiality alignment with N1-N4b, RGPD compliance for biometric data, session storage structure, retention policies
- **Script**: `guardrails.py` — 7 deterministic security gates in Python code: size limits (5MB audio, 2MB image), rate limiting (5 audio/min), command allowlist, master validator `validate_incoming()` that ALL data must pass
- **Script**: `guardrails_pii.py` — PII detection (DNI, IBAN, phone, email, card), raw data auto-expiry (1h), storage quota (100MB), immutable audit log (append-only JSONL)
- **Tests**: `test_guardrails.py` — 14 tests proving gates block oversized data, flooding, unknown commands, PII, full storage. Tests pass without hardware

### Security design

- Gates are Python functions, not LLM instructions — deterministic, untrickable
- Command allowlist: only 12 known commands pass (ping, led, info, sensors, gpio, help, capture_image, capture_audio, speak, set_led, play_tone, status)
- Immutable audit log: every incoming datum logged before processing
- Raw data (audio/images) auto-deleted after 1 hour

- **Skill: prompt-optimizer** + **Command: /skill-optimize**: AutoResearch Loop for self-optimizing skill and agent prompts. Inspired by Karpathy/Eric Risco pattern. Executes skill with test fixture, scores output against weighted checklist (G-Eval 0-10), modifies prompt, re-executes, compares scores. Keeps changes that improve, reverts those that don't. Stop criterion: score >= 8.0 for 3 consecutive iterations. Output saved as `.optimized.md` — original never modified.

- **Prompt optimizer auto-trigger** (`prompt-optimizer/auto-trigger.md`): Protocol for Savia to automatically suggest `/skill-optimize` when agents accumulate 3+ corrections in last 10 executions. Detects explicit signals (PM corrections, re-executions) and implicit signals (low coherence scores, outputs exceeding limits). Auto-generates test fixtures from real usage patterns.

- **coherence-validator.md** + **reflection-validator.md**: Fixed bare MEMORY.md → full 3-level path.
- **.gitignore**: Added `git/` to exclude local infrastructure.

### Fixed

- **Agent audit**: Scanned all 43 agents across 7 dimensions. Fixed 15 agents with structural issues (incomplete frontmatter, outdated references, missing memory paths, missing Phase 4/5 in digest agents). Report: `output/agent-audit-20260319.md`.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-03-17

Era 116 — Universal digest traceability + visual-digest agent with 4-pass contextual OCR pipeline.

### Added

- **Rule: digest-traceability.md**: Universal traceability for all data sources processed by Savia (documents, transcriptions, audio, web, repos, diagrams). Idempotency protocol ensures no source is processed twice. Centralized `_digest-log.md` per project with change detection and archival strategy. Privacy-first: log lives inside `projects/` (gitignored).
- **Agent: visual-digest** (Opus 4.6): 4-pass contextual OCR for whiteboard photos, handwritten notes, paper diagrams, screenshots, and slides. Pipeline: raw extraction → project context loading (reads team/members, business rules, prior digests) → resolution with homonym disambiguation protocol (3 Sergios, 2 Javiers, 2 Alvaros) → cross-verification against verbal digests. Tested: resolved 10 more items than naive OCR, corrected 3 misidentifications.

### Changed

- **Digest workflow**: All digest agents (meeting-digest, document-digest, visual-digest) must now consult `_digest-log.md` before processing and update it after completion.

## [2.99.0] — 2026-03-16

Era 114b — Windows installer zero-touch: auto-install deps, PATH config, parse fixes.

### Fixed

- **install.ps1**: ASCII art reading "Saxia" instead of "Savia"

- **install.ps1**: Windows `python3.exe` Store stub causing NativeCommandError
- **install.ps1**: Clone failure when running from inside the repo
- **install.ps1**: Unicode box-drawing chars rendering as mojibake in PowerShell terminal

### Changed

- **install.ps1**: Auto-install missing dependencies (Git, Node.js, Python, jq) via winget/choco instead of just detecting and aborting
- **install.ps1**: Add Claude Code `~/.local/bin` to user PATH permanently after install
- **install.ps1**: Fallback to `~/pm-workspace` when `~/claude` exists but is not a git repo

## [2.98.0] — 2026-03-15

Era 114 — Git Manager roadmap, E2E screenshot validation rule, settings privacy guard.

### Added

- **Git Manager roadmap** (`specs/roadmap-git-manager.md`): full open-source research (10 projects analyzed: Ungit, isomorphic-git, Gitea, lazygit...), technical design (17 Bridge endpoints, TypeScript interfaces, SVG graph algorithm, security patterns), and 3-week implementation plan
- **Rule: E2E screenshot validation** (`e2e-screenshot-validation.md`): cross-project rule — all web E2E tests must include screenshots for visual confirmation
- **Script: validate-settings-local.sh**: detects private data (localhost URLs, hardcoded paths, session-specific commands) in `settings.local.json` before commit
- **Domain rules**: added `globs` frontmatter for path-specific auto-loading (41 rules)

### Fixed

## [2.97.0] — 2026-03-15

Era 113 — Savia Web: chat multi-thread, tool feedback, markdown quality, session fixes.

### Added

- **Chat tool activity feed**: Live progress inside assistant bubble while Savia uses tools (📄 Reading, 🔍 Searching, 🤖 Delegating...) with pulsing indicator
- **Chat multi-thread**: Session-scoped streaming — responses don't leak between sessions. Stream cancelled on session switch
- **Chat session titles**: "Mar 15, 18:30 — message digest" format with date+time
- **Chat delete persistence**: Deleted sessions tracked in localStorage, won't reappear from Bridge on reload
- **Markdown rendering**: Headings (H1-H3), 10px paragraph spacing, tables with borders, blockquotes, code blocks, lists with indentation, horizontal rules
- **Session active indicator**: Left border accent (violet) + icon color for active session
- **Spec**: chat-multithread, chat-tool-feedback (2 new specs)
- **Rule**: pre-commit-bats — always run `tests/run-all.sh` before commit

### Fixed

- **Session panel width**: Was 0px (missing CSS width), now 260px
- **Delete button hover**: Bigger click area, visible on hover for non-active sessions
- **SSE streaming**: One-shot mode, `Connection: close`, client-side stream break
- **Chat identity**: User context injected in every message (works with --resume)
- **Dashboard**: Greeting field flattened from nested user.greeting
- **BATS**: CHANGELOG Era references, hook set flags, duplicate versión entries

- **Chat session management**: Session list sidebar (260px), New Chat, switch sessions, delete, titles with "date — message digest", localStorage persistence
- **Chat markdown**: Bubbles render markdown (bold, code, lists, links) via `marked`
- **Chat identity**: Bridge injects `[Contexto: usuario=Name, rol=role]` in every message — Savia knows who you are
- **Bridge `/auth/me`**: Returns authenticated user slug + role
- **Bridge user CRUD**: GET/POST `/users`, PUT/DELETE `/users/{slug}`, rotate-token, revoke
- **File access control spec**: Role-based file browser access (admin=root, user=projects only)
- **Create project modal**: Teleport to body, responsive, z-index 9999

### Fixed

- **SSE chat hanging**: Switched from interactive stdin/stdout to one-shot streaming (`claude -p`)
- **Chat input disabled after response**: `Connection: close` header + client-side stream break on `done`
- **Session conflict**: Corrupted sessions detected and invalidated, user gets friendly message
- **Dashboard not loading**: Bridge `user.greeting` flattened to match `DashboardData.greeting`
- **Chat blank on navigation**: `initSession` skips re-init if messages in memory
- **Session delete not reactive**: Changed `filter` to `splice` for in-place mutation
- **Session panel width 0**: Added `width: 260px` + `min-width`

### Stats

## [2.76.5] — 2026-03-10

### Fixed — Savia Mobile v0.3.46: one-shot mode + command pre-fill

- **Savia Mobile chat fix (CRITICAL)**: Switched from interactive bidirectional stream-json to one-shot mode (`-p --output-format stream-json`) — Claude CLI interactive mode does not work as subprocess. Each message now launches a fresh process with `--resume` for session continuity
- **Command pre-fill from palette**: Commands screen now passes selected command text to Chat via navigation query parameter (`?command=encoded`). ChatInput uses `remember(key)` to reinitialize state on new command
- **Unified chat navigation**: Merged duplicate `composable()` routes into single `chat?conversationId={}&command={}` with both optional params
- **Bridge interactive session manager**: Added `InteractiveSession` class with full bidirectional protocol, permission request/response flow, and `/chat/permission` endpoint (infrastructure for future interactive mode)
- **Permission request model**: New `StreamDelta.PermissionRequest` and `sendPermissionResponse()` in `SaviaBridgeService` for tool approval UI
- **Regression test**: 10/10 pass on OUKITEL C36 (Android 14), zero permission popups across 55 operations

## [2.76.4] — 2026-03-10

### Fixed — Era 104: Auditoría — stdin timeout en 4 hooks + documentación

- **Hook stdin timeout (CRÍTICO)**: Aplicado `timeout 3 cat` a `block-credential-leak.sh`, `block-force-push.sh`, `block-infra-destructive.sh`, `tdd-gate.sh` y `validate-bash-global.sh`. Usaban `INPUT=$(cat)` sin timeout, causando "PreToolUse:Bash hook error" al bloquear stdin indefinidamente
- **hooks/README.md**: Documentados 7 hooks faltantes (android-adb-validate, block-project-whitelist, compliance-gate, agent-dispatch-validate, memory-auto-capture). Total: 19 hooks documentados
- **PCRE fallback**: Reemplazado `grep -oP '\K'` por alternativa POSIX en `block-infra-destructive.sh` y `tdd-gate.sh`

## [2.76.3] — 2026-03-10

### Fixed — Era 104: Compound command patterns + APK test robustness

- **APK integration tests**: Added `dismiss_system_dialogs()` to handle Android 13+ notification permission dialog that blocked all test UI interactions. Tests now re-launch app if it goes to background after Bridge connection. All 23/23 APK tests pass

- **Compound `&&`/`||` patterns**: Added `Bash(cd * && *)`, `Bash(cd * || *)`, `Bash(source * && *)`, `Bash(. * && *)` to default permission whitelist. Claude Code's `*` wildcard is shell-aware and does not cross `&&`/`||` operators — a simple `Bash(cd *)` never matched `cd dir && cmd`
- **Hook robustness**: Improved `validate-bash-global.sh` stdin parsing with `printf '%s'` and `IFS= read` for reliable JSON handling
- **setup-claude-permissions.sh**: Updated default generated patterns to include compound command entries and network utilities (`ip`, `ifconfig`, `hostname`)

## [2.76.2] — 2026-03-10

### Fixed — Era 104: adb-run.sh wrapper + hook error fix

- **adb-run.sh**: New single-command runner that replaces `source wrapper.sh && cmd1 && cmd2` chains. Claude Code's shell-aware `*` doesn't cross `&&`/`||` operators, making compound command patterns impossible to whitelist. `adb-run.sh` encapsulates source + functions in one simple command
- **Hook stdin fix**: `validate-bash-global.sh` now uses `read -t 2` with timeout instead of `cat` (which could hang indefinitely waiting for stdin)
- **SKILL.md rewrite**: All examples now use `./scripts/adb-run.sh` pattern exclusively

## [2.76.1] — 2026-03-10

### Fixed — Era 104: CHANGELOG link enforcement + Claude Code permission cleanup

- **CI Gate 6: CHANGELOG Versión Links**: Added validation to `ci-extended-checks.sh` that fails CI if any `## [X.Y.Z]` header lacks its reference link at the end of the file. Prevents the recurring issue of missing comparison links
- **Claude Code permission setup**: New `scripts/setup-claude-permissions.sh` generates `settings.local.json` with glob-based permission patterns (auto-detects Android SDK, JAVA_HOME, ADB). Eliminates the ~50 exact-match ADB commands that caused constant permission popups
- **Installer integration**: Added Step 6 to `install.sh` — runs permission setup automatically during workspace installation
- **Shell-aware permission patterns**: Fixed compound `&&` command patterns — Claude Code is shell-aware and won't auto-approve chained commands with prefix-only patterns. Added explicit `Bash(source wrapper.sh && *)` patterns
- Fixed missing `[2.76.0]` comparison link in CHANGELOG.md

## [2.76.0] — 2026-03-10

### Added — Android Debug Agent: autonomous device testing

- **ADB wrapper library** (`scripts/lib/adb-wrapper.sh`): 40+ functions for device management, APK lifecycle, screenshots, UI hierarchy, interaction (tap/swipe/type/scroll), logcat analysis, crash detection, and element finding. Auto-detects ADB binary and device, includes retry logic and structured JSON output
- **Security hook** (`.claude/hooks/android-adb-validate.sh`): PreToolUse hook classifying ADB operations into safe (auto-approved), risky (logged), and blocked (rejected). Prevents destructive commands while allowing autonomous debugging without permission prompts
- **Debugger skill** (`.claude/skills/android-autonomous-debugger/SKILL.md`): Complete workflow for autonomous debug cycles — install, launch, interact, detect crashes, capture evidence, report results
- **Integration test suite** (`scripts/tests/test-adb-wrapper.sh`): 44 tests covering core functions, security classification, device management, visual capture, logcat, Savia Mobile integration, and hook validation. All tested against physical OUKITEL C36 device
- **Documentation** (`docs/android-debug-agent.md`): Full API reference, architecture diagram, use cases for PM/QA smoke testing, developer debugging, and CI verification. Includes security model and environment variable reference

### Fixed

- **Bridge duplicate text**: Response text no longer appears twice in chat bubbles (result event suppressed when streaming already delivered the content)
- **Bridge session persistence**: Known sessions saved to `~/.savia/bridge/known-sessions.json` — multi-turn conversations survive bridge restarts
- **Bridge "already in use" recovery**: If session conflict detected, session marked as known for automatic retry

### Added

- **Chat timestamps**: Message bubbles display HH:mm time for traceability (SimpleDateFormat with `remember` for performance)

## [2.75.0] — 2026-03-10

### Added — OpenCode Integration: PM-Workspace compatibility layer

- **OpenCode compatibility layer**: Created `.opencode/` with symlinks to original directories (`.claude/`, `docs/`, `projects/`, `scripts/`) for OpenCode tool usage while preserving Claude Code functionality
- **Cross-platform installers**: `install.sh` (Linux/macos) and `install.ps1` (Windows) similar to Claude Code's installers but adapted for OpenCode
- **Hooks integration solution**: Git hooks automation (`scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`) installs pre-commit, pre-push, and commit-msg hooks that automatically validate security/quality gates missing in OpenCode
- **OpenCode wrappers**: `scripts/opencode-hooks/wrappers/safe-*.sh` validate commands before executing with OpenCode tools, bridging the security/quality gap from missing automatic hook execution
- **Documentation**: Updated `.opencode/README.md` with comprehensive OpenCode usage guide and hooks strategy explaining why integration doesn't affect Claude Code's ongoing Savia Mobile work
- **Branch isolation**: Created `feat/opencode-hooks-integration` branch with all OpenCode changes, ready for PR creation without interfering with Claude Code's work on main branch
- **CHANGELOG audit and fix**: Consolidated scattered versión links to end of file, added missing links for versions 2.73.0–2.74.2, ensuring compliance with changelog-enforcement rule

## [2.74.2] — 2026-03-09

### Fixed — Era 103: Chat runtime crash + crash handler

- Fixed Savia Mobile chat crash: replaced `LocalLifecycleOwner`/`DisposableEffect` with `ProcessLifecycleOwner` in `SaviaNotificationManager`
- Added global crash handler (`SaviaApp.installCrashHandler()`) logging to logcat + `last_crash.log`
- Simplified `ChatViewModel` — removed `isAppInForeground` field

## [2.74.1] — 2026-03-09

### Fixed — Era 103: ChatViewModel crash + build gate

- Fixed ChatViewModel crash: added missing `SaviaNotificationManager` mock in unit and integration tests (5 call sites)
- New `buildAndPublish` Gradle task: tests → build → publish chain. If tests fail, no APK gets published. Replaced unsafe `finalizedBy` pattern
- Added Savia Mobile build rule to `CLAUDE.md`: always `./gradlew buildAndPublish`, never `assembleDebug`

## [2.74.0] — 2026-03-09

### Changed — Era 103: All gaps implemented — code review 4-judge panel, file browser, notifications, output persistence

- **Code Review gaps (all 4 done)**: performance-auditor as 4th consensus judge (weights 0.3/0.3/0.2/0.2), parallel dispatch via dag-scheduling, enforced risk-based routing, per-finding confidence curves
- **Bridge file browser**: new `GET /files` and `GET /files/content` endpoints with path traversal prevention and 500KB limit
- **Savia Mobile file browser**: `FileBrowserScreen` with directory listing, code viewer (monospace + line numbers), markdown renderer (Markwon), breadcrumb navigation. New `Screen.Files` route + HomeScreen quick action
- **Android notification permission**: `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` for Android 13+, runtime permission request on launch, `SaviaNotificationManager` singleton with "response complete" notification when app is backgrounded
- **Output persistence**: `SavedOutputEntity` Room table (v2 migration) for persisting Claude-generated outputs (code, reports, snippets) with favorites, type filtering, and conversation linkage. `SavedOutputDao` with CRUD + favorites
- Updated `docs/roadmap-code-review-improvements.md`: all 4 gaps marked as implemented

## [2.73.0] — 2026-03-09

### Changed — Era 102: Pentester integration, Savia Mobile non-blocking chat, code review roadmap

- Integrated `pentester` agent into documentation: agents-catalog (34 agents), adversarial-security rules, README security section
- **Savia Mobile non-blocking chat**: message queue (`Channel<String>`) allows sending multiple messages without waiting for response. Spinner moved from input box to streaming bubble. Pending message count badge on send button
- Fixed SQLCipher dependency visibility: `implementation` → `api` in data module so DatabaseModule (app module) can resolve `SupportOpenHelperFactory`
- Added code review improvements roadmap: confidence scoring, performance analyzer agent, parallel judge dispatch, adaptive review depth
- New doc: `docs/roadmap-code-review-improvements.md`

## [2.72.0] — 2026-03-09

### Changed — Era 101: Pentester v2: Shannon-inspired pipeline architecture

- Rewrote `pentester` agent with autonomous 5-phase pipeline: pre-recon → recon → vulnerability analysis (5 parallel classes) → exploitation (proof-based) → reporting
- **"No exploit, no report"** policy: only Level 3 (impact demonstrated) findings appear in final report. L1 (theoretical) and L2 (partial) go to "Failed Attempts" section for transparency
- Queue-driven architecture: Phase 3 produces JSON vulnerability queues (`03-vuln-{class}.json`) consumed by Phase 4 exploitation — prevents hallucinated findings
- Added JSON schema (`queue-schema.json`) for formal queue validation with per-class ID patterns (INJ-xxx, XSS-xxx, AUTH-xxx, SSRF-xxx, AUTHZ-xxx)
- Phase prompts with Shannon-style framing: "sole responsibility", "mathematical rigor", cascading intelligence between phases
- Proof templates for L3 evidence: data_extraction, rce, auth_bypass, info_leak
- New queue validator script (`validate-queue.py`) for Phase 3→4 handoff validation
- Test suite expanded from 65 to 73 tests: new CAT-11 (Pipeline Architecture, 8 tests) with mandatory 100% on proof enforcement (S-04, S-05)
- Inspired by [KeygraphHQ/Shannon](https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon) (96.15% on XBOW benchmark)

- **guided-work-protocol.md**: Interaction protocol rule — task decomposition, question patterns per level, block detection table, calibrated celebrations ("Hecho. Paso X/N." — never condescending), context recovery, N-CAPS non-linear adaptation. Core principle: "The goal is not speed. It's that the person CAN complete it, at their pace, with dignity and autonomy."
- **inclusive-review.md**: Strengths-first code reviews when review_sensitivity=true. Vocabulary mapping: "Bug"→"Caso no cubierto", "Error"→"Oportunidad de mejora". Structure: strengths → opportunities → constructive close.

Fields: screen_reader, high_contrast, reduced_motion, cognitive_load (low/medium/high), focus_mode, guided_work, guided_work_level (alto/medio/bajo), motor_accommodation, voice_control, review_sensitivity, dyslexia_friendly, break_strategy, break_interval_min.
- **guide-accessibility.md**: Step-by-step guide per disability profile — visual, motor/RSI, ADHD, autism, dyslexia, hearing. Each with recommended config, workflow example, and tips.
- **accessibility-es.md / accessibility-en.md**: Bilingual quick-reference docs with feature list, common configurations table, and FAQ.
- **ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md**: Credits to all inspiring projects (claude-code-templates, kimun, Engram, BullshitBench, claude-mem), studies (LLYC, Fundación ONCE, N-CAPS, DX Core 4, NIST/ISO/EU AI Act), and people (Daniel Avila, Eduardo Díaz, Miguel Luengo-Oroz).
- READMEs updated to link ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md instead of inline credits.

Research sources: Fundación ONCE "Por Talento Digital" (30K+ trained), N-CAPS, arxiv 2411.13950 (ADHD/Autism in Software Development), arxiv 2507.06864 (ADHD-Aware Productivity Framework), DX Core 4.
