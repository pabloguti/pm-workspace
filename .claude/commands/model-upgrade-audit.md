# /model-upgrade-audit $ARGUMENTS

Skill: `@.claude/skills/model-upgrade-audit/SKILL.md`

## Execution

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` -> extract scope and filters
2. Detect current model from pm-config.md
3. Inventory components in scope (glob agents + skills + rules)
4. Launch `model-upgrade-auditor` agent via Task with:
   - Component list with paths
   - Workaround pattern definitions
   - Current model info
5. Collect per-component analysis
6. Write YAML report to `output/model-audit/{date}-audit.yaml`
7. Show summary grouped by recommendation (APPLY / REVIEW / SKIP)

## Output (chat summary)

```

Savings: ~{N} tokens/session ({pct}% reduction)
