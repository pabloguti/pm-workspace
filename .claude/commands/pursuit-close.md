# /pursuit-close — Close pursuit (SE-015)

**Argumentos:** `$ARGUMENTS` — OPP-ID + outcome (won|lost)

## Flujo

1. Parse OPP-ID and outcome from arguments
2. Locate pursuit directory
3. Update pursuit.md stage to won or lost
4. If lost: record competitor who won (if --competitor provided)
5. Generate postmortem.md with structured analysis:
   - Timeline of pursuit stages with dates
   - Qualification scores summary (BANT + MEDDIC)
   - What worked well
   - What could improve
   - Lessons for future pursuits
6. If won: suggest `/pursuit-handoff {OPP-ID}` as next step
