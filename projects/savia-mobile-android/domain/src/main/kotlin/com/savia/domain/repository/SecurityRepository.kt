package com.savia.domain.repository

/**
 * Repository for managing sensitive and security-critical data.
 *
 * This repository abstracts all secure storage operations using Tink (Google's encryption library)
 * combined with Android Keystore for key storage. The implementation ensures that:
 * - All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
 * - Encryption keys are stored in hardware-backed secure enclave (when available)
 * - No plaintext credentials appear in logs or shared preferences
 *
 * ## Architecture
 * The repository operates at the domain layer and delegates to data layer implementations
 * that handle the actual Tink AEAD encryption, key management, and Android platform
 * integration.
 *
 * ## Supported Modes
 * Savia supports two connection modes, each with separate credential storage:
 *
 * ### 1. Anthropic API (Direct Mode)
 * Deprecated but kept for backward compatibility. Stores an API key to call Claude
 * directly from the mobile app (not recommended due to credential exposure).
 *
 * ### 2. Savia Bridge (Preferred Mode)
 * The primary mode. Stores connection parameters to a self-hosted Savia Bridge server:
 * - Bridge host/port for network location
 * - Authentication token for API requests
 *
 * ## Data Encryption
 * Database passphrase is auto-generated on first launch and used to encrypt the Room database.
 * The passphrase itself is stored in Android Keystore (encrypted by OS).
