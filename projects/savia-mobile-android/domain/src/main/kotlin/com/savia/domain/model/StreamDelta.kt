/**
 * Represents a chunk of data from Claude's streaming API response via the Savia Bridge.
 *
 * This sealed class models the different events that can occur during a streaming conversation
 * with Claude. The Bridge server streams responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE), and each
 * event is transformed into a corresponding [StreamDelta] subtype.
 *
 * ## Role in Clean Architecture
 * [StreamDelta] is a domain model that represents the streaming protocol at the business logic
 * level. It abstracts away the raw HTTP/SSE details while providing type-safe handling of
 * stream events in use cases and UI layers.
 *
 * ## Usage Flow
 * 1. Stream begins → emit [Start] with message ID and model info
 * 2. Content arrives → emit [Text] chunks (may occur multiple times)
 * 3. Stream ends → emit either [Done] (success) or [Error] (failure)
 *
 * UI layer observes the flow of [StreamDelta] events and updates the message content
 * and UI state accordingly.
 *
 * ## Streaming Properties
 * - Text chunks arrive independently and may be recombined by the UI
 * - Multiple [Text] events are emitted in order during a single response
 * - A stream should have exactly one [Start] and one terminal event ([Done] or [Error])
 * - Token counting happens at the use case layer after the stream completes
