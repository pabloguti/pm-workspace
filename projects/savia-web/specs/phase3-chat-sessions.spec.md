# Chat Session Management

## Objetivo

Allow users to manage multiple chat sessions like Claude Code CLI: list past sessions, switch between them, start new ones. Sessions persist across page reloads.

## Requisitos Funcionales

### RF-01: Session List Sidebar

- Collapsible panel on the left side of the chat page
- Shows all sessions for the current user, sorted by last activity (newest first)
- Each entry: title (first message truncated to 40 chars), date, message count
- Active session highlighted
- Toggle button to show/hide session list

### RF-02: New Session

- "New Chat" button at top of session list
- Creates a fresh session with new UUID
- Clears message history in the chat view
- Previous session remains in the list

### RF-03: Switch Session

- Click a session in the list to switch to it
- Loads message history from Bridge GET `/sessions/{id}/messages`
- Current session state saved before switching

### RF-04: Session Persistence

- Session list stored in localStorage: `savia:chat:sessions`
- Each session: `{ id, title, createdAt, lastMessageAt, messageCount }`
- On page load, restore last active session
- Messages stored per-session in localStorage: `savia:chat:messages:{id}`

### RF-05: Bridge Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/sessions` | List all sessions (already exists) |
| DELETE | `/sessions/{id}` | Delete a specific session |

### RF-06: Delete Session

- Swipe or delete icon on each session entry
- Confirmation before deleting
- Cannot delete the currently active session (switch first)
