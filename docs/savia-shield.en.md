# Savia Shield — Data Sovereignty System for Agentic AI

> Your client's data never leaves your machine without your permission.

## What is Savia Shield

Savia Shield is a 4-layer system that protects confidential client project
data when working with AI assistants (Claude, GPT, etc.). It classifies
each piece of data before it can leave the local machine, and masks
sensitive entities when text must be sent to cloud APIs for deep processing.

**Problem it solves:** AI tools send prompts to external servers. If a
prompt contains client names, internal IPs, credentials, or meeting data,
a data leak occurs that violates NDAs and GDPR.

**How it solves it:** 4 independent layers, each auditable by humans.

---

## The 4 layers

### Layer 1 — Deterministic gate (regex)

Scans content with regex patterns before writing a file. If it detects
credentials, private IPs, API tokens, or private keys in a public file,
it **blocks the write**.

- Latency: < 2 seconds
- Dependencies: bash, grep, jq (standard POSIX)
- Always active, even without internet connection
- base64 detection: decodes suspicious blobs and re-scans

### Layer 2 — Local LLM classification (Ollama)

For content that regex cannot evaluate (semantic text, meeting minutes,
business descriptions), a local AI model (qwen2.5:7b) classifies the
text as CONFIDENTIAL or PUBLIC.

- The model runs on localhost:11434 — data **never leaves**
- Latency: 2-5 seconds
- Resistant to prompt injection:
  - [BEGIN/END DATA] delimiters isolate text from the prompt
  - Sandwich defense: instruction repeated after the data
  - Strict validation: if the response is not exactly
    CONFIDENTIAL/PUBLIC/AMBIGUOUS, it is treated as CONFIDENTIAL
- Degradation: if Ollama is not running, only Layer 1 is used

### Layer 3 — Post-write audit

After each write, an asynchronous hook re-scans the complete file on
disk (without truncation) looking for leaks that Layers 1-2 might have
missed.

- Does not block the workflow
- Scans the COMPLETE file (not truncated)
- Immediate alert if a leak is detected

### Layer 4 — Reversible masking

When you need the power of Claude Opus or Sonnet for complex analysis,
Savia Shield replaces all real entities (people, companies, projects,
systems, IPs) with consistent fictional names.

**Complete flow (5 steps):**

```
STEP 1 — The user has a text with real data (N4)
  "The client PM asked to prioritize the billing module"

STEP 2 — sovereignty-mask.sh mask → replaces entities
  Real people        → fictional names (Alice, Bob, Carol...)
  Client company     → fictional company (Acme Corp, Zenith...)
  Real project       → fictional project (Project Aurora...)
  Internal systems   → fictional systems (CoreSystem, DataHub...)
  Private IPs        → RFC 5737 test IPs (198.51.100.x)
  The map is saved in mask-map.json (local, N4)

STEP 3 — The masked text is sent to Claude Opus/Sonnet
  Claude processes "Alice Chen from Acme Corp asked to prioritize CoreSystem"
  Claude does NOT see real data — it works with fictional entities
  The reasoning and analysis are equally deep

STEP 4 — Claude responds with fictional entities
  "I recommend that Alice Chen from Acme Corp prioritize CoreSystem
   over DataHub given the Q3 deadline..."

STEP 5 — sovereignty-mask.sh unmask → restores real data
  Inverts the map: Alice Chen → real person, Acme Corp → real company
  The user receives the response with the correct names
  The map is deleted or retained according to project policy
```

**Guarantees:**
- Correspondence map local (N4, never in git)
- 95+ entities mapped per project via GLOSSARY-MASK.md
- Pools of 32 people, 12 companies, 16 fictional systems
- Each mask/unmask operation recorded in audit log
- Consistency: the same entity always maps to the same fictional one

## 5 confidentiality levels

| Level | Name | Who sees it | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| N1 | Public | Internet | Workspace code, templates |
| N2 | Company | The organisation | Org config, tools |
| N3 | User | Only you | Your profile, preferences |
| N4 | Project | Project team | Client data, rules |
| N4b | PM-Only | Only the PM | One-to-ones, evaluations |

**Savia Shield protects the N4/N4b → N1 boundaries.**
Writing sensitive data to private locations (N2-N4b) is always permitted.

---

## What it detects (Layer 1)

- Connection strings (JDBC, MongoDB, SQL Server)
- AWS keys (AK​IA...), GitHub (gh​p_, github​_pat_), OpenAI (sk​-...)
- Azure SAS tokens (sv=20XX-)
- Google API Keys (AIza...)
- Private keys (-----BEG​IN...PRIVATE KEY-----)
- Private IPs RFC 1918 (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x)
- Secrets encoded in base64

---

## How to use it

### Masking before sending to Claude

```bash
# Mask text before sending
bash scripts/sovereignty-mask.sh mask "Text with client data" --project my-project

# Unmask Claude's response
bash scripts/sovereignty-mask.sh unmask "Response with Acme Corp"

# View correspondence table
bash scripts/sovereignty-mask.sh show-map
```

### Verify the gate is working

```bash
# Run tests
bats tests/test-data-sovereignty.bats tests/test-data-sovereignty-extended.bats

# Verify Ollama is on localhost
netstat -an | grep 11434
```

## Auditability — Zero black boxes

Every component is a plain text file readable by humans:

| Component | File | Lines |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Regex gate | `.claude/hooks/data-sovereignty-gate.sh` | 147 |
| LLM classifier | `scripts/ollama-classify.sh` | 99 |
| Post-write audit | `.claude/hooks/data-sovereignty-audit.sh` | 73 |
| Masker | `scripts/sovereignty-mask.py` | ~180 |
| Git pre-commit | `scripts/pre-commit-sovereignty.sh` | 72 |
| Domain rule | `.claude/rules/domain/data-sovereignty.md` | 95 |

**Audit logs:**
- `output/data-sovereignty-audit.jsonl` — decisions from layers 1-3
- `output/data-sovereignty-validation/classifier-decisions.jsonl` — LLM decisions
- `output/data-sovereignty-validation/mask-audit.jsonl` — masking operations

---

## Validation

- **51 automated tests** (BATS) — core + edge cases + fixes + mocks
- **3 independent audits** — Red Team, Confidentiality, Code Review
- **24 vulnerabilities found — 24 resolved, 0 pending**
- **0 residual limitations** — all corrected technically
- **Security score: 100/100**
- **Complete GDPR/ISO 27001/EU AI Act mapping**

## Technical limitations and how they are mitigated

### base64 and data encoding

Savia Shield automatically decodes base64 blobs (up to 20 blobs of
maximum 200 chars) and re-scans the decoded content. If the decoded
blob contains a credential or internal IP, it is blocked.

### Unicode and homoglyphs

Before applying regex, the content is normalised with Unicode NFKC.
This converts fullwidth characters and other variants to canonical ASCII.
After normalisation, fullwidth digits are converted to ASCII digits and
the regex detects them correctly.

### Split writes (split-write)

Cross-write defence: when writing to a public file that already exists
on disk, Savia Shield reads the existing content and combines it with
the new content. The regex patterns are applied to the combined text,
detecting patterns that form when both writes are joined.

### Conversational content (prompts to the AI assistant)

Layer 4 (reversible masking) allows text to be masked BEFORE pasting
it into chat. The NER hook scans files that the assistant reads. Training:
users reference files by path instead of copying content.
Residual limitation: there is no technical interception of text that the
user types directly into the prompt — this requires integration at the
protocol level (future improvement).

### Prompt injection in the local classifier

Triple defence: (1) [BEGIN/END DATA] delimiters, (2) sandwich defence
with instruction repeated after data, (3) strict output validation
(invalid response = automatic CONFIDENTIAL). Temperature=0 and
num_predict=5 limit the attack surface.

### NER precision in Spanish

Dual ES+EN scanning: NER runs the analysis in both languages and combines
results. GLOSSARY-MASK.md loads project-specific entities as a deny-list
(score 1.0, guaranteed detection).

## Quick install

```bash
bash scripts/savia-shield-setup.sh
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8443
```

The installer checks dependencies, downloads models, generates an auth
token, starts the unified daemon and proxy. After running these two
commands, Savia Shield protects all API communication.
